"Good Design"
=======

In fact, this document is not only about the Design, but also focusing that several kind of the themes of the recent news.

The original question for me was "What is good design?" as a non-designer's viewpoint. But in fact this includes Security, Writings, and AI... and so on.
So, this is the summary of my question among recent article from each news.

Many design guides explain the theory, or pattern. But they don't explain the reason why it is needed in the design. 
I'm not a designer so I wonder why the theory is needed and the pattern is effective in every particular cases.

I'd like to focus on each reason of the background of the theory of design, and want to dive into the deeper understanding of the BETTER UI.
Also, in such a stance, it will summarize a few kind of the aspects.
